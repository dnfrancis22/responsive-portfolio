# responsive-portfolio

**Description**

This is a site that I created to display information about my self. There are three pages. About Me, Portfolio, and Contact page. The About Me page is where I have a short biography about my self. I also share links to my LinkedIn site, GitHub and my email address. The Portfolio page currently has place holder images, however it is a place where I can display future projects. The last page is the Contact page. There are input boxes for name and email as well as an input box for a short message.

I made the site responsive so that the site can easily be viewed on mobile devices as well as desktop displays.

**Installation**

Click on the settings tab.
Scroll down to the section that says GitHub Pages.
Click on the link in the green box next to "your site is published at".

Or you can just click here: https://dnfrancis22.github.io/responsive-portfolio/

On the about page you can click on any of the links provided. They will take you to either my LinkedIn site, GitHub or allow you to send me an email.

If you grab the side of the browser window and drag to the side to shrink the window to its smallest viewing size you can see the site as if you were viewing it on a smaller device such as a phone or tablet.
